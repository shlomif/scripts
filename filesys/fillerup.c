/*
 * Fills up a filesystem. Yes, there are use cases for such code. Like
 * when /var is 100% full (or more, or sometimes negative, according to
 * the OS and df(1) involved, and whether the user that filled the
 * partition was root or not) yet du(1) or find(1) only show much less
 * than available space consumed, or at least when one needs to recreate
 * and test such a condition, as opposed to learning it live in
 * production like I did (in particular, via the rm(1) of the file that
 * is still being written to).
 *
 *   fillerup [-h] [-q] filename
 *
 * The supplied filename will be created and written to. A USR1 signal
 * will cause the attempted close(2) of the file descriptor. The -q flag
 * will disable the default printing of the PID (which is otherwise
 * handy to pass to `kill -USR1 ...`). All output is to stderr, and
 * usually only when something is awry.
 *
 * Old system portability: use strlen, extirpate O_NOFOLLOW, maybe more,
 * depending on signal handling or other things I do not know about.
 *
 * Disabling the error-on-write might also be profitable, if one does
 * not care to see that.
 *
 * Some testing results:
 *
 *   * OpenBSD 5.2 shows 105% full and -89632 Avail after the root
 *     reserved space is run through. (Otherwise "0" and 100%.)
 *   * A Mac OS X disk image (extended filesystem) offers no root
 *     reserved space.
 *   * An old RedHat Linux 7.3 virt shows 100% full, even after the root
 *     reserved space is run int. (And "0" Avail.)
 *
 *  Other things to test:
 *
 *   * Sparse files and how various things view how much space those use
 *     (mess around with lseek(2) calls).
 *   * rm the file being written to and find what various utilities can
 *     show the unlinked but as-yet active inode.
