bruteln.c tries (a lot) to make a symlink, mainly as test for
feasibility of /tmp symlink exploits (quite feasible!); these exploits
would be much less of a thing if a) folks simply did not write files to
such directories or b) instead used mktemp(3) or equivalent.

Alas, learning from history is not something humans do, given that 2016
saw such jaw-droppers as:

 * CVE-2016-3100 - "kinit in KDE Frameworks before 5.23.0 uses weak
   permissions (644) for /tmp/xauth-xxx-_y, which allows local users to
   obtain X11 cookies of other users and consequently capture keystrokes
   and possibly gain privileges by reading the file."
 * CVE-2016-3992 - "cronic before 3 allows local users to write to
   arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a (1) cronic.out.$$, (2)
   cronic.err.$$, or (3) cronic.trace.$$ file in /tmp."

against the fact that mktemp(1) first appeared in OpenBSD 2.1 two
decades ago. Note also that while some OS do create private /tmp
directories, this is by no means universal.
