/* pedaltime - script to collect timing information on MIDI pedal
 * events. Assumes OpenBSD w/ MIDI attached. run via:
 *
 *   make pedaltime
 *   ./pedaltime /dev/rmidi0 | tee results
 *
 * this was motivated by lilypond N\sustainOff\sustainOn half-pedals
 * being marked as a simultaneous event in the MIDI, which is not
 * physically possible. so how long does a half-pedal actually take?
 *
 * MIDI is (mostly) little-endian; this code has only been run on a
 * little-endian system so there may be portability issues on
 * big-endian systems */
