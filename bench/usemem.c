/*
 # (Ab)uses memory via the allocation of a block of memory, with a given
 # number of worker threads that then read and write values randomly
 # within that space. This code was motivated by the fact that while
 # `perl -e '1 while 1' &` can run up the CPU, one is more likely to run
 # into fork limits than CPU bottlenecks on modern multi-processor
 # systems. This code better exercises a system. Basically, it offers a
 # means to bog a system down, presumably for testing purposes, race
 # condition exploration, or to annoy the local sysadmin.
 #
 # System resource limits may need to be adjusted; see login.conf(5) on
 # OpenBSD, for example. There may also be per-process limitations. A
 # good way to bog the system down is to run something like:
 #
 #   for i in ...; do ./usemem -M -t ... & done
 #
 # Where the number of processes to launch and the thread count are
 # suitable to the number of CPUs or desired level of insanity. A timed
 # pkill(1) or easy access to reset the test system should be arranged
 # for, given that too many instances of this program may render a
 # system quite inoperative--a desktop linux system `vmstat 1` recorded
 # 12 million context switches in an entry, presumably over some time
 # period longer than a second, given how poorly that system was
 # performing. Shortly thereafter, the display froze up, and the system
 # had to be power cycled (I could still ping the box).
 #
 # The original intent of this code was to try to trigger a race
 # condition on:
 #
 #   alarm(...);
 #   somethingthatblocksforever();
 #   alarm(0);
 #     // -- paraphrased from Stevens, APUE (1st edition), p. 286.
 #
 # whereby the system is made busy enough that the SIGALRM happens
 # before the somethingthatblocks() call can be started, but after the
 # alarm(...) is established, so that the process then blocks forever.
 # It is perhaps far more likely that the system will be rendered
 # unusable (and monitoring notice this) than to hit this unlikely edge
 # case. If a system has been inordinately busy or slow, a reboot may
 # well be in order as soon as is practical. This will eliminate the
 # possiblilty that any process remains stuck on some rare edge case
 # such as the above.
 #
 # Portability: -M does sensible things on OpenBSD; on Linux and Mac OS
 # X it runs afoul various amounts of stupidity or insanity that may
 # require `-M -m upperlimit` to set the maximum allowed allocation.
 # This will help prevent the OOM killer from blasting away or the
 # kernel optimistically trying to allocate 17,592,186,044,416 integers
 # and then somehow getting bogged down.
 #
 # The code used to try to realloc() the array upwards, if possible,
 # though that on Linux ran afoul the OOM killer. Since dead processes
 # do not much tax a system, only downsizes are done. Launch more
 # instances of this script to use up the remaining memory.
 #
 # Swapping might be induced by starting an instance, then sending it
 # the CONT signal, then starting more instances? Need to test this.
