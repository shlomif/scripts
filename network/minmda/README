minmda - a minimal mail delivery agent

this is a minimal mail delivery agent, written to support delivery to
maildir directories when typically being called by fetchmail-type
programs. minmda will fail delivery (via the EX_TEMPFAIL exit code) if a
checksum of what is written to disk fails, or if various other things go
awry. in the maildir filename instead of parsing gethostname(3) on each
delivery that value is instead taken from the second argument to this
program. doing so avoids the random hostnames my laptops acquire as they
move around, but does push that configuration need elsewhere.

minmda depends on libsodium


Installation (for a user)

    make
    mkdir ~/libexec
    mv minmda ~/libexec

see minmda(8) for fetchmail and getmail configuration examples


Testing

with perl and App::cpanminus installed and configured (and possibly also
local::lib installed and configured)

    make test-depend
    make test


Adapting and using this code

 * it has been used on OpenBSD (6.x) and Mac OS X (10.11) portability
   to other systems is mostly untested
 * the default umask may be too conservative for cases where group
   access is required to the mail files
 * additional calls such as fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC) on Mac OS X may be
   desirable to better ensure that the bits reach disk?
 * there is no code to support delivery to a different user account (so
   at present minmda must be used from a .forward file or otherwise
   setup for each user account individually)
 * if the filesystem performs checksums perhaps remove the checksum code
   from this program to not duplicate that effort (and determine whether
   this code catches the errors reported by that filesystem properly...)
   (or if the checksums are slow and you don't care about the mail)
 * various errors are sent to stderr; this may not be desirable
   depending on what the caller does with stderr, or those logs might
   instead be sent to syslog(3) (or the errors may not include enough
   detail about the temporary mail file path, etc)
 * the temporary delivery file may be unlinked if something fails. a
   different design might try to keep those files (so at least their
   contents can be read) though that would require monitoring to look
   for deliveries stuck in the tmp dir
 * no calls to free() are made on account of the program exiting
   once its work is done. this will likely cause alarms from memory
   leak checkers
