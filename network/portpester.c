/*
 * Utility to pester TCP ports with: connect flood testing. Tested on OpenBSD,
 * Mac OS X. 389-ds had a production flaw that this utility was handy to
 * test whether they had fixed it yet:
 *
 * https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=668619
 *
 * Previously I was testing with `while true; do nmap -PN -sT ...` in
 * the shell, which caused huge overhead launching the many millions of
 * nmap processes. This vastly more efficient while-loop-around-TCP-connect
 * is much faster, though shifts the bottleneck to the available
 * ephemeral port range of the test system. (Which, on a multi-use system,
 * may adversely affect other programs.) So want something that can auto-tune,
 * or to accept shaping arguments that specify how far the program can go.
 *
 * TODO grab standard tuning algorithm (naive approach I tried had...problems).
 *
 * For greater efficiency, root + raw sockets would be required, as could then
 * drop packets onto the network, and (perhaps) ignore responses?
 *
 * TODO means to throw data out over the connection.
