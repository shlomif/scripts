.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sends packets to the
.Xr udp-sink 1
command. The packets contain a counter value, possibly padded out to
.Ar packetsize
amount of data.
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Send on IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Send on IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl C Ar maxpackets
Exit after sending
.Ar maxpackets .
.It Fl c Ar statsinterval
Emit statistics every
.Ar statsinterval
packets sent. This logs how quickly the client is sending.
.It Fl d Ar delay
Wait
.Ar delay
milliseconds after sending a packet, or instead nanoseconds if
.Fl N
is employed.
.Fl f
is incompatible with this option.
.It Fl f
Flood send packets.
.Fl d
is incompatible with this option.
.It Fl l
Make stdout line buffered.
.It Fl N
Changes
.Fl d
argument units to nanoseconds.
.It Fl P Ar packetsize
Pad sent data to
.Ar packetsize .
.It Fl p Ar port
Send to UDP
.Ar port .
.El
.Pp
The arguments used should ideally agree with those in
.Xr udp-sink 1
for any given test. Only one 
.Nm
instance should send to a
.Xr udp-sink 1
instance, as multiple senders will confuse the packet counting.
.Sh OUTPUT FORMAT
The statistics are whitespace delimited, and include the timestamp and
number of packets set for a given
.Ar statsinterval
count of sent packets.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
will send until
.Ar maxpackets
have been sent (0 exit status), or an exit status >0 if an error occurs
or the process is terminated. SIGINT will cause
.Nm
to emit a final statistics line before exiting.
