.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
emits UDP packets, possibly to the
.Xr udp-sink 1
command. The packets contain a counter value that can be padded out to
.Ar packetsize .
Options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Send on IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Send on IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl C Ar maxpackets
Exit after sending
.Ar maxpackets .
.It Fl c Ar statsinterval
Emit statistics every
.Ar statsinterval
packets sent. This logs how quickly the client is sending.
.It Fl d Ar delay
Wait
.Ar delay
milliseconds after sending a packet, or instead nanoseconds if
.Fl N
is employed.
.Fl f
is incompatible with this option.
.It Fl f
Flood send packets.
.Fl d
is incompatible with this option.
.It Fl l
Make stdout line buffered. See
.Xr setbuf 3
for the defaults.
.It Fl N
Changes
.Fl d
argument units to nanoseconds.
.It Fl P Ar packetsize
Pad sent data to
.Ar packetsize .
.It Fl p Ar port
Send to UDP
.Ar port .
Mandatory.
.El
.Pp
The arguments used should agree with those in
.Xr udp-sink 1
for any given test. Only one 
.Nm
instance should send to a
.Xr udp-sink 1
instance; multiple senders will confuse the packet counting.
.Sh OUTPUT FORMAT
The statistics are whitespace delimited and include the timestamp and
number of packets set for a given
.Ar statsinterval
count of sent packets.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
will send until
.Ar maxpackets
have been sent (0 exit status), or an exit status >0 if an error occurs
or the process is terminated. SIGINT will cause
.Nm
to emit a final statistics line before exiting.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Assuming
.Cm udp-sink
is running somewhere appropriate,
.Pp
.Dl $ Ic udp-sender -p 2952 -f localhost
.Pp
Do note that without throttling
.Nm
can send large numbers of packets which may cause your MAC address or
network uplink port to be blacklisted or disabled.
.Pp
There is multicast support, though this has not be tested much and will
likely need additional work and improvements:
.Pp
.Dl $ Ic udp-sender -4 -p 1234 224.0.66.66
.Dl $ Ic udp-sender -6 -p 1234 FF15:0:0:0:0:0:0:101
