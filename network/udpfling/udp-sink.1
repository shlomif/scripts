.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
accepts packets from the
.Xr udp-sender 1
command and emits statistics on the packets received. The packets
contain a counter value, possibly padded with
.Ar packetsize
amount of data.
.Nm
checks the counter value, detects out-of-order packets, and emits
statistics about packet loss each
.Ar statsinterval
number of packets received.
.Pp
Options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 4
Listen on IPv4 addresses only.
.It Fl 6
Listen on IPv6 addresses only.
.It Fl c Ar statsinterval
Emit statistics every
.Ar statsinterval
packets received. A lower value will be necessary under heavy packet loss
situations.
.It Fl d Ar delay
Wait
.Ar delay
milliseconds after processing a packet, or instead nanoseconds if
.Fl N
is employed.
.It Fl l
Make stdout line buffered.
.It Fl N
Changes
.Fl d
argument units to nanoseconds.
.It Fl P Ar packetsize
Assume data from
.Xr udp-sender 1
is of size
.Ar packetsize .
.It Fl p Ar port
Listen on UDP
.Ar port .
.El
.Pp
The arguments used should ideally agree with those in
.Xr udp-sender 1
for any given test. Only one 
.Xr udp-sender 1
instance should send to a
.Nm
instance, as multiple senders will confuse the packet counting.
.Sh OUTPUT FORMAT
The statistics are whitespace delimited, and include the timestamp,
packet loss count, packet count, packet loss percentage, and a count of
out-of-order packets for a given
.Ar statsinterval
count of received packets.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
will listen until terminated, or abort with an exit status >0 if an error
occurs. SIGINT will cause
.Nm
to emit a final statistics line before exiting.
