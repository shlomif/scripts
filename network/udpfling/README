udp-sender sends packets and udp-sink listens for them. a counter is
passed in the packet soas to detect lost or out-of-order packets. error
checking is done at most every step, insofar as UDP allows for that.
packets can be sent quickly, usually to test how network gear reacts to
such floods. if you want a bandwidth test try instead iperf

goptfoo must first be installed

note that network admins may disable your network access if you generate
too much traffic

Centos7 requires CFLAGS along the lines of

    -D_BSD_SOURCE -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199309L -D_POSIX_SOURCE

to compile


Usage:

    ./udp-sender
      -4 | -6     selects IPv4 or IPv6 (default is unspecified)
      -c n        send count packets (default is a large number)
      -d ms | -f  delay in milliseconds or flood the packets (default 5 ms)
      -N          -d is in nanoseconds not milliseconds
      -P octets   pad packet to this many octets (default sizeof(uint32_t))
      -p portnum  port number to send to - mandatory
      hostname    host or IP address to connect to - mandatory

    ./udp-sink
      -4 | -6     selects IPv4 or IPv6 (default is unspecified)
      -c n        print stats ever so many packets (default 10000)
      -d ms       delay in milliseconds after processing a packet
      -l          line buffer output instead of default - see setbuf(3)
      -M address  listen to the given multicast address
      -N          -d is in nanoseconds not milliseconds
      -P octets   pad packet to this many octets (default sizeof(uint32_t))
      -p portnum  port number to listen on - mandatory

so to collect packets:

    ./udp-sink -p 2952 -c 10000 -l | tee log

and to elsewhere feed it:

    ./udp-sender -p 2952 -f localhost

the sink may need a low -c argument if high packet loss is expected,
as fewer packets will get through and thus the stats will be printed
less often

there is multicast support, though this has not be tested much and will
likely need additional work and improvements:

    ./udp-sink -c 100 -4 -p 1234 -M 224.0.66.66
    ./udp-sink -c 100 -6 -p 1234 -M FF15:0:0:0:0:0:0:101

    ./udp-sender -4 -p 1234 224.0.66.66
    ./udp-sender -6 -p 1234 FF15:0:0:0:0:0:0:101
