 * Experiment with manually changing the environ(7) pointer. So, yeah, quite
 * possible for something misbehaved to muss with the pointer and create a
 * duplicate environment entry:
 *
 *   make muss-with-environ && ./muss-with-environ env | grep '^'PATH
 *
 * As to why any application would do such, well, that's a good question, and
 * I've certainly never seen it in production, but someone on #zsh claimed to
 * have seen duplicate environment entries on Mac OS X somehow...might also be
 * handy to test application behavior in such a wacky case.
