.Dt COPYCAT 1
.nh
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm copycat
.Nd copy stdin to both stdout and to the clipboard
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Bk -words
.Nm
.Op Fl n
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
copies standard input to both standard output and to the command
mentioned in the
.Ev CLIPBOARD
environment variable, or to
.Xr pbcopy 1
if
.Ev CLIPBOARD
is not set. With the
.Fl n
flag the ultimate newline (if present) will not be printed.
.Pp
With
.Xr tmux 1
on Mac OS X the tmux-pasteboard package may be of service.
.Pp
In hindsight,
.Xr xclip 1x
does have a
.Fl filter
flag but that would not help on Mac OS X.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
The
.Cm pbcopy
command can be emulated under X11 with a wrapper script
.Pp
.Dl #!/bin/sh
.Dl exec xsel -l /dev/null -i -b
.Pp
as
.Xr xsel 1x
used directly may guess incorrectly on what to do when used under
.Xr vi 1 .
The
.Fl b
flag operates on the
.Dv CLIPBOARD
selection for compatiblity with certain web browser software; other
software such as
.Xr xterm 1
may need to be adjusted to also use this:
.Pp
.Dl xterm*selectToClipboard: true
.Pp
Then, in
.Cm vi ,
one may use a filter over some range to copy the desired lines both to the
clipboard and to retain them in
.Cm vi .
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
.Ic :%!copycat
.El
.Pp
to copy the entire document to the clipboard, or arbitrary data using
arbitrary range statements:
.Pp
.Dl Ic :.,+4!copycat
.Pp
.Dl Ic ma5k:.,'a!copycat
.Pp
for the present line and following four, or to set a mark, move up some
lines, then filter from the current line to that mark. If one moves
down, the filter will need to be from the mark to the current line:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
.Ic ma5j:'a,.!copycat
.El
.Pp
Though this is all best practiced and made automatic via motor memory.
See also "Practical Vim" for other tips.
.Pp
In
.Xr vim 1 ,
the keepmark statement will be necessary to preserve any marks through
the filter:
.Pp
.Dl Ic :keepmark %!copycat
.Pp
With the X11-enabled version of
.Xr vim 1
the special star register should obviate the need for this script, e.g.
.Bl -item -offset indent
.It
.Ic :%y *
.El
.Pp
to yank to the X11 clipboard. But I do not use that flavor of 
.Xr vim 1 ,
and there are other non-vim contexts that require copying of
terminal data.

.Pp
As an alternative, instead use a FIFO, which might run something like
.Pp
.Dl $ Ic mkfifo asdf
.Dl $ Ic $CLIPBOARD < asdf &
.Dl $ Ic tee asdf
