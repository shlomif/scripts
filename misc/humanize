=head1 NAME

humanize - humanizes file sizes in data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Make df(1) output readable on systems lacking the human output option:

  $ df -k | humanize -rk

Figure out what 3655004 is in bytes:

  $ humanize 3655004

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Intended as a quick way to humanize the output from random programs
that displays unreadable file sizes, such as df(1) on large file
systems:

  $ df -k | grep nfs
  nfs:/mbt    1026892400 704296472 322595928    69%    /mbt

While certain utilities now support humanized output internally, not
all systems have those utilities.  Hence, this perl script is intended
to fill that gap until more utilities support humanization routines
directly.  This will become more important as file systems continue to
grow, and the exact number of bytes something takes up less meaningful
to the user.

The data munged by this script is less accurate, in that rounding is
done in an effort to make the numbers more readable by a human.  In
the above case, the munged data would look like:

  $ df -k | grep nfs | humanize -k
  nfs:/mbt    1.0T 672G 308G    69%    /mbt

=head2 Normal Usage

  $ humanize [options] [values]

See L<"OPTIONS"> for details on the command line switches supported.

Data to be humanized may either be specified on the command line, or
piped in via standard input.

=head1 OPTIONS

This script currently supports the following command line switches:

=over 4

=item B<-h>, B<-?>

Prints a brief usage note about the script.

=item B<-b> I<base>

Optional integer to factor the incoming data by.  The humanizing
routine operates on bytes by default, so numbers of different formats
will have to be adjusted accordingly.

The value should be one that adjusts the incoming data to be in bytes
format; for example, incoming data in Kilobytes would need a base of
1024 to be converted properly to bytes, as there are 1024 bytes in
each Kilobyte.

=item B<-k>

Overrides B<-b> and treats the incoming data as if in Kilobytes.

=item B<-M>

Treat incoming data as if in Megabytes.

=item B<-G>

Treat incoming data as if in Gigabytes.

=item B<-m> I<regex>

Optional perl regex to specify what in the incoming data should be
operated on; the default of digit runs of four or more characters
should be reasonable in most cases.

Your regex should match integers of some kind; otherwise, the script
will generally do nothing with your data and not print any warnings.
If you are matching numbers inside of a more complicated regex, you
will need to put parentheses around the number you want changed, and
use non-capturing parentheses for preceding items, as only $1 is
passed to the humanizing routine.  See perlre(1) for more details.

If you leave parentheses out of your regex, they will be added around
it by default.  This lets you supply regex like '\d{7,}' and have it
work, which is the same as saying '(\d{7,})' in this case.

=item B<-r>

Align humanized numbers to the right by padding them with spaces.  Good
to preserve columns from utilities such as df(1).

Option to read humanizing prefs from a external location would be a
nice idea.

=head1 HISTORY

Inspired from the B<-h> option present in GNU df, which is sorely
lacking in commercial variants of the same name.  (On the other hand,
leaving the job of humanizing to an external script is probably more
inline with the Unix philosophy of filters.)
