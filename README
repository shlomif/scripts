scripts for unix

there are sporadically unit tests, run

    make depend
    make test

these require Perl and various modules notably App::cpanminus and
possibly local::lib already installed and configured (and make, a
compiler, etc)

there is also sometimes documentation; the *.1 files should be copied
somewhere into $MANPATH unless you like reading roff

 * the assembly is mostly just for practice (though may be educational)
 * the C is primarily written for Mac OS X or OpenBSD; portability is
   largely untested. most of it requires C99 and modern system calls.
   use `make ... CC=... CFLAGS=...` if you need a different C compiler
   or CFLAGS set
   - on OpenBSD, `doas pkg_add gcc` and then `make ... CC=egcc` or
     remove -fno-diagnostics-color from the CFLAGS (though the base
     compiler in 6.2 on amd64 does have trouble with "inline"
   - if on Linux, have fun with the feature_test_macros(7) which may or
     may not require random defines like -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L when
     compiling. code herein that uses glob(3) is likely not at all
     compatible with Linux
 * Perl verion 5.16 is assumed for the tests (compatibility with the
   Centos 7 legacy verion of perl); some scripts will work on older
   versions. Perl::MinimumVersion is most handy here
 * the shell code is generally tested under /bin/sh on OpenBSD and the
   Heirloom Bourne Shell (jsh) on Mac OS X. that's where the
   /usr/local/bin/sh thing comes from; this avoids bash on the Mac
 * TCL version 8.6 is required for some of the TCL code, 8.5 otherwise
 * there's also some Common Lisp and Go if you dig around enough
