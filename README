various C and Perl and TCL and shell scripts for unix

there are sporadically unit tests, run

   make depend
   make test

these require Perl (or TCL) and various Perl (or TCL) modules

 * the C is primarily written for Mac OS X or OpenBSD; portability is
   largely untested. most of it requires C99 and various modern system
   calls. use `make ... CC=... CFLAGS=...` if you need a different C
   compiler or CFLAGS set
 * on OpenBSD, `doas pkg_add gcc` and then `make ... CC=egcc` or remove
   -fno-diagnostics-color from the CFLAGS (though the base compiler in
   6.2 does have trouble with some of the inline C code...)
 * if on Linux, have fun with the feature_test_macros(7) which may or
   may not require random defines like -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L when
   compiling. code herein that uses glob(3) is likely not at all
   compatible with Linux
 * Perl verion 5.14 is assumed for the tests, though some of the scripts
   will work on older versions. Perl::MinimumVersion is most handy here
 * TCL version 8.5 or higher is required for much of the TCL code
 * the shell code is generally tested under /bin/sh on OpenBSD and the
   Heirloom Bourne Shell (jsh) on Mac OS X. that's where the
   /usr/local/bin/sh thing comes from; this helps avoid bash on the Mac
