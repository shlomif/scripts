various C and Perl and TCL and shell scripts for unix

there are sporadically unit tests, run

    make depend
    make test

these require Perl (or TCL) and various Perl (or TCL) modules

 * the C is mostly written for Mac OS X or OpenBSD; portability beyond
   that is largely untested. most of it requires C99 and various modern
   system calls. where there is reluctant Linux support, compile coaxing
   has been mostly done on Centos 7. use `make ... CC=... CFLAGS=...` if
   you need a different C compiler or CFLAGS set. in theory, either a
   clang or gcc of recent enough vintage should work
 * on OpenBSD, `doas pkg_add gcc` and `make ... CC=egcc` or remove
   -fno-diagnostics-color from the CFLAGS (though the base compiler may
   still have trouble with some of the inline C code...)
 * Perl verion 5.14 is assumed for the tests, though some of the scripts
   will work on older versions. Perl::MinimumVersion is most handy here
 * TCL version 8.5 or higher is required for much of the TCL code
 * the shell code is generally tested under /bin/sh on OpenBSD and the
   Heirloom Bourne Shell (jsh) on Mac OS X. that's where the
   /usr/local/bin/sh thing comes from; this helps avoid bash on the Mac
