scripts for unix

there are sporadically unit tests, run

    make depend
    make test

these require Perl and various modules notably App::cpanminus and
possibly local::lib already installed and configured (and make, a
compiler, etc)

there is also sometimes documentation; the *.1 files should be copied
somewhere under a MANPATH directory unless you like reading roff

 * the Assembly is mostly just for practice (though may be educational)
 * the C is primarily written for Mac OS X (10.11) or OpenBSD;
   portability is largely untested. most of it requires C99 and modern
   system calls. use `make ... CC=... CFLAGS=...` if you need a
   different C compiler or CFLAGS set
   - if on Linux, have fun with the feature_test_macros(7) which may or
     may not require random defines like -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L when
     compiling. add those to the make rule as necessary? code herein
     that uses glob(3) is way not compatible with Linux
 * Perl version 5.24 is used in places though the code could likely be
   ported backwards if really necessary
 * the shell code is generally tested under /bin/sh on OpenBSD and the
   Heirloom Bourne Shell (jsh) on Mac OS X
 * TCL version 8.5 is required for the TCL code (8.6 isn't really yet
   available for the systems I run) and also sometimes tcllib
