various C and Perl and TCL and shell scripts for unix

there are sporadically unit tests, run

  make depend; make test

these require Perl (or TCL) various Perl (or TCL) modules and generally
assume a unix system

 * the C is mostly written for Mac OS X or OpenBSD; portability beyond
   that is largely untested. most of it requires C99 and likely various
   modern system calls. where there is reluctant Linux support, compile
   coaxing has been mostly done on Centos 7
 * Perl verion 5.14 is assumed for the tests, though some of the scripts
   will work on older versions. Perl::MinimumVersion is most handy here
 * TCL version 8.5 or higher is required for much of the TCL code
 * the shell code is generally tested under /bin/sh on OpenBSD and the
   Heirloom Bourne Shell (jsh) on Mac OS X. that's where the
   /usr/local/bin/sh thing comes from; this helps avoid bash on the Mac
