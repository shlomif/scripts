Various C and Perl and shell and TCL scripts for unix.

There are sporadically unit tests, run

  make depend; make test

or the individual tests then with `prove t/foo.t`. These require Perl,
various Perl modules, and generally assume a Unix environment.

 * C -- mostly written for Mac OS X and OpenBSD; portability beyond that
   is largely untested. Most of it requires C99 and likely various
   modern *BSD system calls.
 * Perl verion 5.14 is assumed for the tests, though some of the scripts
   will work on older versions.
 * Shell code is generally tested against `sh` on OpenBSD and the
   Heirloom Bourne Shell on Mac OS X.
 * TCL lower than version 8.5 has not been tested for, and likely will
   not work on account of the use of {*} and other such modern
   constructs.
