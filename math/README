Biased data for chisq tests taken from "Understanding Statistics: Basic
Theory and Practice", Grant Foster, 2013, p. 275, who derives an
q=167.7767 (X-squared) from that data:

  % r-fu equichisq - < biased-d6 
  [1] "elements 1236 unique 6"
  
          Chi-squared test for given probabilities
  
  data:  tab
  X-squared = 167.7767, df = 5, p-value < 2.2e-16

chii instead gives a p-value of 2.17476e-34, which I suppose *is* less
than the 2.2e-16 value quoted by R...
