# Converts arguments into standard input for command given as first
# argument. Useful where a utility can only run a named command without
# passing input; this utility can accept input on the command line, and
# pass it on standard input to something else. This is limited by the
# maximum limit allowed for command line length, and opposite of the
# xargs(1) utility.
#
# Example: my 'ow' script only runs a named command followed by the URL,
# while pbcopy on Mac OS X only converts standard input to the
# clipboard. Ergo, running 'sgrax pbcopy $URL' properly gets the URL
# into the clipboard.
