/* modulo-bias - test for modulo bias in poor random number generation;
 * the bias does not appear where RAND_MAX is much larger than m. for a
 * three-sided dice roll, the last RAND_MAX to fail what I think is a
 * chi-squared 0.05 test is 257; given a system RAND_MAX of a much
 * larger value, this would likely only be of concern if the modulo m is
 * very, very large, or if an 8-bit system is being used. better results
 * are obtained where m evenly divides RAND_MAX; RAND_MAX of 100000 and
 * m = 4 only fails at 62 and below (assuming no errors on my part)
 *
 * actually, the exact numbers depend on the rand() implementation and
 * the seed; Mac OS X rand() produced the 257 for an arbitrary seed;
 * this version tries out multiple seeds (TRIALS) and emits what is
 * likely the maximum failure of the fitness test for that seed.
 * However! it still remains that if RAND_MAX is much larger than the
 * range, there is no (statistically significant) modulo bias */
