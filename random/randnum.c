/************************************************************************
 * Penny wise, pound foolish random number generation: entropy hit is
 * only when the srandomdev() call seeds the generator, and only if the
 * count runs up near 16*((2**31)-1) should a reseed be necessary.
 * Otherwise, far more likely that bugs in your custom implementation
 * will reduce or bias the random numbers generated (this one has had
 * several and probably has more), so if such a custom generator is
 * needed, it must have a strong test suite, and the output subjected to
 * statistical tests. Which would be time doubtless better spent doing
 * other things.
 *
 * And, for many hours of coding and debugging, at ~34 extra lines of
 * code, it emits 536870911 random numbers in the range of 12 about 10%
 * faster than just calling random() % randrange (though other ranges
 * will doubtless show varying performance, depending on how well they
 * line up to bit size boundaries). Hooray? A library version that used
 * "all the random bits" and offered dynamic range selection of varying
 * amounts of bits was about *twice* as slow as just calling random()!
 *
 * Also, use arc4random() and family instead of srandomdev/random anyways.
